Just compile /designer_ext/src/designer_ext.pas
You may use designer_ext.lpi for Lazarus/Typhon or designer_ext.prj for MSEide/ideU.

If you want to use last fpgui-develop branch, edit => define.inc
and uncomment {$DEFINE fpgui-develop}.

If you want to use dynamic loading of Xorg and Xft, edit => define.inc
and uncomment {$DEFINE DYNLOAD}.
Depends of the fpGUI branch you are using, copy + paste all files 
in /designer_ext/src/xxx_dynx11 into /designer_ext/src/.

If you want assistive for designer_ext => copy /src/sakit folder => into your main application folder (or where you want) .
Then in "Settings" => choose the parent directory of /sakit.

For total integation with fpc, Lazarus and Typhon, Geany, external-code-editor, ..., you may use the patches...
Those patches are in /designer_ext/patch.

Please read the readme-patch-file before to apply patch.
